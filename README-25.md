## Conditional Expression
Conditional Expression in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false. The syntax used to create conditional control flow in Python is if, elif, and else

### *if* Condition
Used to anticipate conditions that occur during the program and determine what actions will be taken in accordance with the conditions.
If the condition evaluates to False, the if statement/condition will not be executed.

### *else* Condition
a condition where ***if*** the statement is **True** then the code in the ***if*** will be executed, but if the value is **False** then the code in the ***else*** will be executed.

### *elif* Condition
With ***elif*** we can create program code that will select several possibilities that can occur. Almost the same as the ***else*** condition, the difference is that the ***elif*** condition can be many and not just one.
